I ordered this online because no one around town had this and we needed it for a trip coming up for the weekend. Not only did it arrive two days before we left but it was 3$ cheaper to buy online + 2-Day shipping (which got here in 1 day). The mattress is great and our 3 yr old loves it. The mattress protector is just a fleece fitted sheet and nice to have and having the air pump and the carry bag is a life saver as well. Setup and put up is simple and takes a couple of minutes at most. Highly recommend this product for your toddler(s).,Positive

"I picked up this book happy to read that someone had the courage to tackle the issues of the working poor. Sadly, this book misses and misses dreadfully. Ms. Newman spent years of research and it comes across that she sat in her academic office and never had the guts to go into the neighberhoods she represents in her book. She blames the poor for most of their problems instead of the companies who pay wages that aren't livable. Why didn't she write a book about companies that feel it's ok to pay someone $5.00 and hour and expect them to survive in life. How can we as humans think this is acceptable behavior. If her so called Burger Barn cut some of it's profits and gave it to the workers, just think you'd have happy encouraged workers and billionaires who maybe can't buy a new plane that year.",Negative

It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy.

We tried to use this steam vac the day we received it following all the instructions to the letter. It started leaking from several spots on the several of the seams where the plastics met. We called Hoover and they said it was common and we would need to take it into a service center. When we did that the service center told us it would be at least a week before they could work on it. I am so thankful that Amazon has such a great return policy and they are so easy to use. I am going to send it back and get a refund and buy a bissell steam vac.PS I did what some of the people who said that if it leaks that you need to press the trigger and the surge button. I tried it for about ten min and was not able to get anything to snap like what other reviewers said to do.,Negative

"I hate when non-Christians attack Christian books and claim to have read them. This isn't one of those cases. I am a sincere Christian who loves half of what Yancey writes and finds the other half to be somewhat forced. I bought this book with lots of anticipation. I loved the title and was eager to explore its contents. After several weeks, I was only able to make it halfway through the book. Boredom stopped me in my tracks. Not one of Yancey's best efforts. I'm not trying to be mean, rather, just want to give the purchaser a true observation. Don't get me wrong, two of Yancey's books are SPECTACULAR. Those would be ""The Jesus I Never Knew"" (Which I consider to be the best book ever written) and ""Disappointment with God"" (Which also was spectacular). If you want a good book, read one of these two works of Yancey's. As for ""Reaching the Invisible God,"" I wouldn't buy it.",Negative

"This is my third Harmony Remote, and is the best yet. Like all of the previous models, it supports every A/V device I own and the web-based setup has a good balance of ease-of-use and flexibility.The interchangable face plates are a nice extra, but not a major factor in my selection. The button layout is very good and the LCD screen can be set up to add a couple of buttons needed for specific devices. (I added the ""live"" button for my Hi-Def DVR as an example).This is a good value when compared to other ""universal remotes"" and the Tech Support is amazing. I replaced at least five remotes and support the following components: 50"" HDTV, HD DVR, Receiver, DVD player, VCR, 5 disc CD player, and an old dual cassette deck.",Positive

"I ordered a garmin nuvi 205 and also a protective case for the nuvi. The garmin nuvi 205 was fine, but the package the protective case came in had already been opened. It was probably sent back to Amazon by someone else, and Amazon passed it on to me. I thought that was VERY poor customer service. I will be careful from now on if I ever order from Amazon again. I am very disappointed with Amazon. Shame on you! Now get your act together.",Negative
