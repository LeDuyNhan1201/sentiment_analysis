I ordered this online because no one around town had this and we needed it for a trip coming up for the weekend. Not only did it arrive two days before we left but it was 3$ cheaper to buy online + 2-Day shipping (which got here in 1 day). The mattress is great and our 3 yr old loves it. The mattress protector is just a fleece fitted sheet and nice to have and having the air pump and the carry bag is a life saver as well. Setup and put up is simple and takes a couple of minutes at most. Highly recommend this product for your toddler(s).,Positive

"I picked up this book happy to read that someone had the courage to tackle the issues of the working poor. Sadly, this book misses and misses dreadfully. Ms. Newman spent years of research and it comes across that she sat in her academic office and never had the guts to go into the neighberhoods she represents in her book. She blames the poor for most of their problems instead of the companies who pay wages that aren't livable. Why didn't she write a book about companies that feel it's ok to pay someone $5.00 and hour and expect them to survive in life. How can we as humans think this is acceptable behavior. If her so called Burger Barn cut some of it's profits and gave it to the workers, just think you'd have happy encouraged workers and billionaires who maybe can't buy a new plane that year.",Negative

It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window.

We tried to use this steam vac the day we received it following all the instructions to the letter. It started leaking from several spots on the several of the seams where the plastics met. We called Hoover and they said it was common and we would need to take it into a service center. When we did that the service center told us it would be at least a week before they could work on it. I am so thankful that Amazon has such a great return policy and they are so easy to use. I am going to send it back and get a refund and buy a bissell steam vac.PS I did what some of the people who said that if it leaks that you need to press the trigger and the surge button. I tried it for about ten min and was not able to get anything to snap like what other reviewers said to do.,Negative

"I hate when non-Christians attack Christian books and claim to have read them. This isn't one of those cases. I am a sincere Christian who loves half of what Yancey writes and finds the other half to be somewhat forced. I bought this book with lots of anticipation. I loved the title and was eager to explore its contents. After several weeks, I was only able to make it halfway through the book. Boredom stopped me in my tracks. Not one of Yancey's best efforts. I'm not trying to be mean, rather, just want to give the purchaser a true observation. Don't get me wrong, two of Yancey's books are SPECTACULAR. Those would be ""The Jesus I Never Knew"" (Which I consider to be the best book ever written) and ""Disappointment with God"" (Which also was spectacular). If you want a good book, read one of these two works of Yancey's. As for ""Reaching the Invisible God,"" I wouldn't buy it.",Negative

The button layout is very good and the LCD screen can be set up to add a couple of buttons needed for specific devices. (I added the ""live"" button for my Hi-Def DVR as an example).This is a good value when compared to other ""universal remotes"" and the Tech Support is amazing.

"Clark Gable plays a high-stakes gambler who decides to cool his heels in a small town near NYC when he feels the law breathing too close down his collar. There he meets Carole Lombard, the local librarian. They fall in love - at least she does, and they marry; Gable acts like it's a big joke. Of course, he gradually falls in love with her and even decides to turn himself in to the law. He's sentenced to three months in the slammer (he tells her he's going away to South America on business), and when he gets out, our happy couple is reconciled. The script is a good one, and the interplay between Gable and Lombard is lively and romantic. They really make a good pair, and it's a shame it was their only picture together, though they would marry in 1939. Worth a watch.",Positive

I bought it after reading all of the great reviews that it got, but for all for nothing. The other gun that we use is an older Senco.

Apparently dvd's put out under the Vestapol label of Stefan Grossmans label are not instructional videos. Nowhere did it states this when I bought this. So I say don't waste your money like I did.

"I read Green Mars because it is a recent Hugo Award winner, and I read Red Mars because it precedes Green Mars. The books document the first 150 years after manned landing on Mars and detail its colonization and terraformation, and wars between settlers on Mars and Earth. I found both books to be pretty boring. The characters are actually quite well-developed---four-dimensional---but not one is very likable. The descriptions of the technologies that allow the settlers to colonize Mars, terraform it, and prolong their lives are fascinating and seem well-studied. However, many interesting plots are introduced and then allowed to fade away, including the murder that opens the first book and the mystical powers of the Mars-born Nirgal that open the second book. There are long, drawn-out passages describing the Martian landscape, its history, and its natural versus its man-influenced evolution. If I read Blue Mars, it will only be to say I read all three.",Negative

We rarely get rain but, when we do, it's usually a thunderstorm with high winds and a downpour for about 5 - 10 minutes. The box held up well for those types but did not do as well for a huge storm that lasted over an hour. Not typical for us but the box did not keep out the water so now we know. That is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. I could not find any outdoor box that could keep out the rain 100%. It did, however, keep out bugs and scorpions which is almost worth an extra star! I highly recommend the Suncast Deck Box!",Positive

"I'm surprised there are a number of negative comments about this book -- I almost didn't read it because of them, but now I'm sure glad I did. I really thought the author did an exceptional job on the narrative -- fresh, creative descriptions and a protagonist with interesting and clever thoughts! It amazed me how Ephron can draw for us a seemingly ordinary day in the protagonist's life -- and turn it into a plot that keeps you there. She also uses dialogue creatively to reveal characters' personalities. Ending was thoughtful and real. Thanks, Delia!",Positive
